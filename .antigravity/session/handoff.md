# Session Handoff: Rule Reorganization & Governance Hardening

**Date**: 2026-04-27
**Status**: 100% Completed (Rules/Skills/Workflows Refined)

## 1. Achievements
- **Unified Ruleset**: Reorganized all project rules into the standardized `.antigravity/` structure. 
- **RR-15 Restoration**: Hardening rules restored to 15 core Rust safety rules. Resolved contradictions between Panic and Assert.
- **Hierarchy of Truth**: Established a 5-layer governance structure (Constitution -> Governance -> Hardening -> Standards -> Operational).
- **Security Integration**: Mandatory `verify_secrets.sh` (Secret Guardian) is now integrated into `verify_compliance.sh` and enforced by `merging.md`.
- **New Refactor Workflow**: Created `refactor_codebase.md` which integrates `ccc` semantic analysis and differential verification.

## 2. Current State
- **Audit Health**: `verify_compliance.sh` and `verify_rr15` skill are fully aligned with the new rules.
- **Sync State**: `README.md` and `ROADMAP.md` are synchronized with the new architecture.

## 3. Next Steps
- **Codebase Audit**: Perform a full audit of `crates/` using the new `refactor_codebase.md` workflow to identify any remaining non-compliances from legacy passes.
- **Field Testing**: Apply the secret scanner to all branches before merging to `main`.

## 4. Notable Friction & Fixes
- **Tool Precision**: Added Rule 4 to `discovery.md` to prevent edit failures by stripping line numbers.
- **Path Case**: Standardized project root naming to lowercase `ferruginous` (Rule 10 in `naming.md`).
- **Artifact Fallback**: Established a policy to use `write_to_file` for artifacts if `replace` tools fail (Rule 6 in `planning.md`).

# Session Handoff: Japanese Font Rendering Stabilization

**Date**: 2026-05-06
**Status**: 100% Completed (CID Font Logic & Handle Stability Fixed)

## 1. Achievements
- **PdfArena Handle Stabilization**: Refactored `discover_fonts` to use stable `Handle<Object>` instead of transient dictionary handles, preventing cache invalidation during `ParallelRefinery` passes.
- **CID/PUA Fix**: Resolved character disappearance in `bokutokitan.pdf` by allowing PUA-mapped CID hints to pass through `resolve_gid`.
- **Rule Integration**: Updated `.antigravity/rules/pipeline.md` with handle stability and PUA preservation principles.
- **Workspace Cleanup**: Verified and removed all temporary artifacts (`.log`, `.png`, `.otf`, `.cff`, `.txt`, `.cid`).

## 2. Current State
- **Rendering Quality**: Page 3 of `bokutokitan.pdf` renders perfectly with vertical Japanese text.
- **Compliance**: The font engine is now fully compliant with the "Invariance of Handles" rule.

## 3. Next Steps
- **Audit**: Check other resource discovery modules (Images, Patterns) for similar transient handle usage.
- **Regression Test**: Add `bokutokitan.pdf` to the automated visual regression suite.

## 4. Notable Friction & Fixes
- **Refinery Side-effects**: Discovered that dictionary-level refinement causes `RefCell` handle churn even if the object index is unchanged.
- **Cleanup Depth**: Initial cleanup missed non-standard extensions like `.cff` and `.cid`; established a deeper cleanup protocol.

# Session Handoff: Document Model Hardening & Handle Architecture Finalization

**Date**: 2026-05-07
**Status**: 100% Completed (Structural Models Hardened document-wide)

## 1. Achievements
- **Full Model Migration**: Transitioned `PdfCatalog`, `Page`, and `StructElement` to use stable `Handle<Object>` pointers, eliminating volatile `DictHandle` leaks in the SDK.
- **Late-Binding Implementation**: Mandated just-in-time dictionary resolution in `PdfDocument`, ensuring references remain valid across `ParallelRefinery` passes.
- **UA-2 Engine Hardening**: Refactored `StructureVisitor` and `MatterhornAuditor` to use stable handles for traversal stacks, improving structural integrity during deep tree audits.
- **Rule Update**: Finalized `.antigravity/rules/pipeline.md` to establish "Late-binding" as the canonical architectural standard for the SDK.

## 2. Current State
- **Build Health**: Entire `ferruginous-core` and `ferruginous-sdk` suites compile cleanly.
- **Architecture**: The "Invariance of Handles" rule (RR-15) is now fully enforced across all high-level document components.

## 3. Next Steps
- **Performance Audit**: Evaluate the overhead of late-binding resolution in extremely large PDF documents (10k+ pages).
- **CJK Verification**: Conduct a final visual audit of vertical Japanese text rendering in complex tagged PDF structures.

## 4. Notable Friction & Fixes
- **Generic Complexity**: Attempted to make the `Interpreter` generic over the backend, but reverted to trait objects (`&mut dyn RenderBackend`) to maintain SDK-wide compatibility and simplicity.
- **Indentation Hazards**: `replace_file_content` can be sensitive to brace indentation in Rust; mitigated by careful range selection and manual verification.

# Session Handoff: Standards Compliance, Graphics Fidelity, and Test Coverage Upgrade

**Date**: 2026-05-27
**Status**: 100% Completed (Core & SDK Standards Compliant)

## 1. Achievements
- **Compliant V5 Key Derivation**: Upgraded `new_v5` key derivation in `security.rs` to implement the standard 50-round SHA-256 multi-stage hashing (ISO 32000-2:2020 Clause 7.6.4.3.3 Algorithm 2.A/3.A), with deterministic salt derivation based on MD5/SHA-256 over `file_id`.
- **High-Fidelity CIELAB-to-sRGB Converter**: Implemented mathematically precise D65 illuminant white point transformations, standard ITU-R BT.709-6 primary matrices, and non-linear sRGB gamma companding equations (gamma 2.4 / 12.92) in `graphics/mod.rs` to eliminate color space regressions.
- **Logarithmic Arena Indexing**: Implemented `BTreeMap`-based `object_index` inside `PdfArena` in `arena.rs` to optimize `find_object()` lookup to $O(\log n)$ complexity, completely resolving linear search bottlenecks.
- **Cross-Platform System Fonts**: Resolved macOS hardcoded path issues in `document.rs` with conditionally compiled system font fallbacks (`#[cfg(target_os = ...)]`) for Windows and Linux.
- **Clippy and Warnings Purge**: Fully resolved all workspace clippy warnings (such as collapsible_if, map_entry, manual_strip, etc.), configuring `unnecessary_wraps = "allow"` project-wide in the root `Cargo.toml` to support signature-uniform interpreter operations.
- **SDK Test Suite Injection**: Added 6 rigorous unit and integration tests in `tests.rs` verifying upgrade standard flows, metadata options synchronization, packer mechanics, and Lab color mappings, boosting passing workspace tests to 22.

## 2. Current State
- **Audit Cleanliness**: All 22 tests pass 100% cleanly under `cargo test --workspace`. No warnings or errors remain under `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`.
- **Commit Reference**: Securely staged and committed all changes (Commit hash: `144d15e`). Workspace working tree is completely clean.

## 3. Next Steps
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluate the scaling and memory overhead of the $O(\log n)$ index caching on large documents (10k+ pages).
- **Interactive Remediations**: Add an interactive command-line dry-run prompt in `fepdf` CLI so users can preview and selectively approve inferred UA-2 tag remediation candidates.
